    "We will use the `psmc` tool to estimate the effective population size for our data. But instead of directly using bam files, we will use a variant calling format (vcf) file as the starting point. In this tutorial, we will first take a look at a vcf file, then look at how a vcf file is converted to an input for `psmc` using a custom python script. And finally, run psmc on simulated and real data to see how well we can estimate effective population size $N_e$. Note that `psmc` relies on high coverage data where we can estimate genotypes accurately, which is one of the reasons we are working in our exercises with vcf files. "

The advantage here is that here we know what the true population size should be, so therefore we can test whether `psmc` is able to give a correct result. In the second part of the exercises, we will use data from the 1000 genomes project, namely 2 human individuals, NA12718 - a CEU female sample (Northern European ancestry), and NA19471 - a female Luhya sample from Kenya, to compare and contrast how the effective population sizes vary between these two populations. Lastly, we will use one sample of European cattle (*Bos taurus*): Limousin_ROUSTAN, one sample from their close relative, the Bali cattle (a domesticated population of the banteng, *Bos javanicus*): N_7B, and one sample that is the hybrid offspring of a Bali cattle and a regular cattle: N_31B. The latter sample will help us to understand what happens when we analyze an admixed sample using `psmc`."
