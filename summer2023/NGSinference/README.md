In this session you will learn how to do:
* genotype calling
* allele frequency estimation
* variant (or SNP) calling

We are using the program [ANGSD](http://popgen.dk/wiki/index.php/ANGSD) (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data).
More information about its rationale and implemented methods can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420514).

According to its website *ANGSD is a software for analyzing next generation sequencing data. The software can handle a number of different input types from mapped reads to imputed genotype probabilities. Most methods take genotype uncertainty into account instead of basing the analysis on called genotypes. This is especially useful for low and medium depth data.*

Please make sure to follow these preparatory instructions below before running these examples. 
Briefly, you need to set the path to the software and various data that will be used.
Also, you will have to create two folders on your working directory, one for your results and one for your intermediate data.

```bash
NGS=/ricco/data/matteo/Software/ngsTools

DIR=/home/matteo/Copenhagen
DATA=/ricco/data/matteo/Data
REF=$DATA/ref.fa.gz
ANC=$DATA/anc.fa.gz

mkdir Results
mkdir Data
```

--------------------------------------------------

### Workflow

The workflow for this practical looks like this

![stages](./stages.png)

which seems daunting! 
However, that's not the case and we will go through each step to understand each one of them.

The workflow is roughty divided into four steps:

0. Data filtering and I/O
1. Genotype likelihoods
2. Genotype calling
3. SNP calling

---------------------------------------------

#### 0. Data filtering and I/O

First, we will learn **how to build a command line in ANGSD**.

</details>

ANGSD can accept several input files, as described [here](http://popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input):

* BAM, CRAM, mpileup
* VCF, GLF, beagle

Here we show how ANGSD can also perform some basic filtering of the data.
These filters are based on:

* quality and depth, see [here](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Filters)
* SNP quality, see [here](http://popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/SnpFilters)
* sites, see [here](http://popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Sites)

<details>

<summary> click here to have a look at our list of BAM files </summary>

```bash
cat $DATA/ALL.bams
wc -l $DATA/ALL.bams
ls $DATA/*.bams
```

</details>

If the input file is in BAM format, the possible options are visible with `$NGS/angsd/angsd -bam`.

```
</details>


First we need to define input and output files (please note that here we do not run these intermediate steps, as you can see thare is a ```#``` in the front):
```bash
# $NGS/angsd/angsd -b ALL.bams -ref $REF -out Results/ALL \
...
```
with `-b` we give the file including paths to all BAM files we need to analyse.
`-ref` specifies the reference sequence.
`-out` states the prefix for all output files that will be generated.

Next we need to define some basic filtering options.
First we define filters based on reads quality.
```bash
# $NGS/angsd/angsd -b ALL.bams -ref $REF -out Results/ALL \
#        -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
...
```
These filters will retain only uniquely mapping reads, not tagged as bad, considering only proper pairs, without trimming, and adjusting for indel/mapping (as in samtools).
`-C 50` reduces the effect of reads with excessive mismatches, while `-baq 1` computes base alignment quality as explained here ([BAQ](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml)) used to rule out false SNPs close to INDELS.

Also, you may want to remove reads with low mapping quality and sites with low quality or covered by few reads (low depth).
Under these circumnstances, the assignment of individual genotypes and SNPs is problematic, and can lead to errors.
We may also want to remove sites where a fraction (half?) of the individuals have no data.
This is achieved by the ```-minInd``` option.

In order to understan which filter to use, it is important to visualise the distribution of quality scores and depth.
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -b $DATA/EUR.bams -ref $REF -out Results/EUR \
        -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
        -minMapQ 20 \
	-doQsDist 1 -doDepth 1 -doCounts 1 -maxDepth 40 &> /dev/null

Rscript $NGS/Scripts/plotQC.R Results/EUR 2> /dev/null
```

Let's visuale the results.
```bash

less -S Results/EUR.info
evince Results/EUR.pdf
```

![stage0A](./stage0A.png)

A possible command line would contain the following filtering:
```bash
...
# $NGS/angsd/angsd -b ALL.bams -ref $REF -out Results/ALL \
#        -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
#        -minMapQ 20 -minQ 20 -minInd 5 -setMinDepth 7 -setMaxDepth 30 -doCounts 1 \
...
```
which corresponds to the following scenario:

Parameter | Meaning |
--- | --- |
-minInd 5 | use only sites with data from at least 5 individuals |
-setMinDepth 7 | minimum total depth of 7 |
-setMaxDepth 30 | maximum total depth of 30 |

More sophisticated filtering can be done, but this is outside the scope of this practical.

---------------------------------------

#### 1. Genotype likelihoods

![stage1](./stage1.png)

We now wish to calculate the ***genotype likelihoods*** for each site at each individual.

To do so you need to specify which genotype likelihood model to use.
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -GL
```

<details>

<summary> click here to see GL options </summary>

```
-GL=0: 
	1: SAMtools
	2: GATK
	3: SOAPsnp
	4: SYK
	5: phys
	6: Super simple sample an allele type GL. (1.0,0.5,0.0)
	7: outgroup gls
	-trim		0		(zero means no trimming)
	-tmpdir		angsd_tmpdir/	(used by SOAPsnp)
	-errors		(null)		(used by SYK)
	-minInd		0		(0 indicates no filtering)

Filedumping:
	-doGlf	0
	1: binary glf (10 log likes)	.glf.gz
	2: beagle likelihood file	.beagle.gz
	3: binary 3 times likelihood	.glf.gz
	4: text version (10 log likes)	.glf.gz
```
</details>

A description of these different implementation can be found [here](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Genotype_likelihoods).
The GATK model refers to the first GATK paper, SAMtools is somehow more sophisticated (non-independence of errors), SOAPsnp requires a reference sequence for recalibration of quality scores, SYK is error-type specific.
For most applications and data, GATK and SAMtools models should give similar results.

Let's assume to analyse European (Italian, of course) samples only.
A possible command line to estimate allele frequencies might be:
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -b $DATA/EUR.bams -ref $REF -out Results/EUR \
        -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
        -minMapQ 20 -minQ 20 -minInd 5 -setMinDepth 7 -setMaxDepth 30 -doCounts 1 \
        -GL 2 -doGlf 4 2> /dev/null
```
where we specify:
* -GL 2: genotype likelihood model as in GATK
* -doGlf 4: output in text format

Ignore the various warning messages (if any).

![stage1A](./stage1A.png)

------------------------------------------

#### 2. Genotype calling

![stage2](./stage2.png)

Here we will explore several ways to call genotypes from sequencing data.
We will also calculate genotypes probabilities to each site for each individual.

In ANGSD, the option to call genotypes is `-doGeno`:
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -doGeno
```

<details>

<summary> click here to see calling genotypes options </summary>

```
-doGeno 0
        1: write major and minor
        2: write the called genotype encoded as -1,0,1,2, -1=not called
        4: write the called genotype directly: eg AA,AC etc
        8: write the posterior probability of all possible genotypes
        16: write the posterior probability of called genotype
        32: write the posterior probabilities of the 3 gentypes as binary
        -> A combination of the above can be choosen by summing the values, EG write 0,1,2 types with majorminor as -doGeno 3
        -postCutoff=0.333333 (Only genotype to missing if below this threshold)
        -geno_minDepth=-1       (-1 indicates no cutof)
        -geno_maxDepth=-1       (-1 indicates no cutof)
        -geno_minMM=-1.000000   (minimum fraction af major-minor bases)
        -minInd=0       (only keep sites if you call genotypes from this number of individuals)

        NB When writing the posterior the -postCutoff is not used
        NB geno_minDepth requires -doCounts
        NB geno_maxDepth requires -doCounts
```
</details>

Therefore, if we set `-doGeno 2`, genotypes are coded as 0,1,2, as the number of alternate alleles. A value of -1 indicates a missing (uncalled) genotype.
If we want to print the major and minor alleles as well then we set `-doGeno 3`.

To calculate the posterior probability of genotypes we need to define a model.
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -doPost
```

<details>

<summary> click here to see genotype models </summary>

```
-doPost 0       (Calculate posterior prob 3xgprob)
        1: Using frequency as prior
        2: Using uniform prior
        3: Using SFS as prior (still in development)
        4: Using reference panel as prior (still in development), requires a site file with chr pos major minor af ac an
```
Therefore, `-doPost 2` uses a uniform prior.
</details>

Furthermore, this calculation requires the specification of how to assign the major and minor alleles (if biallelic).
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -doMajorMinor
```

<details>

<summary> click here to see major/minor options </summary>

```
        -doMajorMinor   0
        1: Infer major and minor from GL
        2: Infer major and minor from allele counts
        3: use major and minor from a file (requires -sites file.txt)
        4: Use reference allele as major (requires -ref)
        5: Use ancestral allele as major (requires -anc)
        -rmTrans: remove transitions 0
        -skipTriallelic 0
```
</details>

A typical command for genotype calling is (assuming we analyse our EUR samples):
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -b $DATA/EUR.bams -ref $REF -out Results/EUR \
	-uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
        -minMapQ 20 -minQ 20 -minInd 5 -setMinDepth 7 -setMaxDepth 30 -doCounts 1 \
	-GL 2 -doGlf 1

$NGS/angsd/angsd -glf Results/EUR.glf.gz -fai $REF.fai -nInd 10 -out Results/EUR \
	-doMajorMinor 1 -doGeno 3 -doPost 2 -doMaf 1
```
Let's ignore the `-doMaf` option now.

Have a look at the output file:
```bash
less -S Results/EUR.geno.gz
```
The columns are: chromosome, position, major allele, minor allele, genotypes is 0,1,2 format.

**QUESTION**
How many sites have at least one missing genotype? Why is that?

<details>

<summary> click here to see the answer </summary>

```bash
zcat Results/EUR.geno.gz | grep -1 - | wc -l
```
You can control how to set missing genotype when their confidence is low with `-postCutoff`.
</details>

Why are there some many sites with missing genotypes?

The mean depth per sample is around 2-3X, therefore genotypes cannot be assigned with very high confidence.
Setting this threshold depends on the mean sequencing depth of your data, as well as your application.
For some analyses you need to work only with high quality genotypes (e.g. measure of proportion of shared SNPs for gene flow estimate), while for others you can be more relaxed (e.g. estimate of overall nucleotide diversity).
We will show later how to accurately estimate summary statistics with low-depth data.

![stage2A](./stage2A.png)

--------------------------------

**EXERCISE 1**

If we assume HWE, then we can use this information as prior probability to calculate genotype posterior probabilities.
The command line would be:
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd -glf Results/EUR.glf.gz -fai $REF.fai -nInd 10 -out Results/EUR \
        -doMajorMinor 1 -doGeno 3 -doPost 1 -doMaf 1
```
using the option `-doPost 1`.

We are finally ready to gather some biological insights from the data.
Recalling our research aim, our first goal is to calculate allele frequencies of our target variant in EDAR gene for different human populations.

Our SNP of interest is located in EDAR gene.
According to the reference [paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160519/ncomms11616/full/ncomms11616.html), *The derived G allele at the index SNP in this region (rs3827760) encodes a functional substitution in the intracellular death domain of EDAR (370A) and is associated with reduced chin protrusion*.
The genomic location of this SNP is `chr2:109513601-109513601`.

In ANGSD we can restrict our analyses on a subset of positions of interest using the `-sites` option.
The file with these positions need to be formatted as (chromosome positions).
```bash
echo 2 109513601 > Data/snp.txt
```
We need to index this file in order for ANGSD to process it.
```bash
$NGS/angsd/angsd sites index Data/snp.txt
```

We are interested in calculating the derived allele frequencies, so are using the ancestral sequence to polarise the alleles.
We also want to compute the allele frequencies for each population separately.
We need to use a different file for each population, with a different list of BAM files, as provided:
```bash
ls $DATA/*.bams
```
```
/ricco/data/matteo/Data/AFR.bams  /ricco/data/matteo/Data/EAS.bams  /ricco/data/matteo/Data/LAT.bams
/ricco/data/matteo/Data/ALL.bams  /ricco/data/matteo/Data/EUR.bams  /ricco/data/matteo/Data/NAM.bams
```
We retain only these populations: AFR (Africans), EUR (Europeans), EAS (East Asians), LAT (Latinos), NAM (Native Americans).

Back to our example of functional variants in EDAR, we want to assign individual genotypes by first computing genotype posterior probabilities for all samples.
Finally we will calculate the **derived** allele frequencies based on assigned genotypes.

Note that we are interested in calculating the **derived** allele frequency, so we need to specify a putative ancestral sequence.
Let's assume that our reference sequence represents the ancestral sequence too.
Please finally note that we want to relax out filtering to make sure to have results.

Write the code that performs the following genotype calling for EDAR variants in all populations.
Also, you can directly call genotypes without generating the genotype likelihood files, by starting from bam files directly.
As an indication, you can follow these guidelines:
- use the SAMtools genotype likelihood model
- calculate genotype posterior probabilities using a HWE-based prior
- filter out bases with a quality score less than 20
- filter our reads with a mapping quality score less than 20
- use ony sites where you have at least one sample with data (-mindInd)
- do not set any filtering based on min and max depth
- use -doMajorMinor 1 and -doMaf 1 options
- set genotypes as missing if the highest genotype probability is less than 0.50
- use option `-sites Data/snp.txt` to restrict the analysis only on selected sites
but feel free to choose some parameters yourself.

```bash
...
```

<summary> click ![here](./solutions.md) for a possible solution </summary>

Once done, open the output files and calculate the derived allele frequency by counting genotypes.
What is the derived allele frequency for each population?

Can you comment these results?
Do you see any allele frequency differentiation in the derived state?

In the original paper, Authors state that *The G allele at rs3827760 is not present in Europeans and Africans but is seen at high frequency in East Asians and is essentially fixed in Native Americans.*
Are your results in agreement with this?

Why is it not at high frequency in the Latino sample?

----------------------------

#### 3. SNP calling

![stage3](./stage3.png)

We now want to estimate allele frequencies at each site without relying on genotype calls.
In other words, at each site we want to to estimate (or count) how many copies of different alleles (two in case of biallelic variants) we observe in our sample (across all sequenced individuals).
However with low depth data direct counting of individually assigned genotypes can lead to biased allele frequencies.

ANGSD has an option to estimate **allele frequencies** taking into account data uncertainty from genotype likelihoods:
```
$NGS/angsd/angsd -doMaf
...
-doMaf  0 (Calculate persite frequencies '.mafs.gz')
        1: Frequency (fixed major and minor)
        2: Frequency (fixed major unknown minor)
        4: Frequency from genotype probabilities
        8: AlleleCounts based method (known major minor)
        NB. Filedumping is supressed if value is negative
-doPost 0       (Calculate posterior prob 3xgprob)
        1: Using frequency as prior
        2: Using uniform prior
        3: Using SFS as prior (still in development)
        4: Using reference panel as prior (still in development), requires a site file with chr pos major minor af ac an
Filters:
        -minMaf         -1.000000       (Remove sites with MAF below)
        -SNP_pval       1.000000        (Remove sites with a pvalue larger)
        -rmTriallelic   0.000000        (Remove sites with a pvalue lower)
Extras:
        -ref    (null)  (Filename for fasta reference)
        -anc    (null)  (Filename for fasta ancestral)
        -eps    0.001000 [Only used for -doMaf &8]
        -beagleProb     0 (Dump beagle style postprobs)
        -indFname       (null) (file containing individual inbreedcoeficients)
        -underFlowProtect       0 (file containing individual inbreedcoeficients)
NB These frequency estimators requires major/minor -doMajorMinor
```

Therefore, the estimation of allele frequencies requires the specification of how to assign the major and minor alleles (if biallelic).
```
$NGS/angsd/angsd -doMajorMinor
...
        -doMajorMinor   0
        1: Infer major and minor from GL
        2: Infer major and minor from allele counts
        3: use major and minor from a file (requires -sites file.txt)
        4: Use reference allele as major (requires -ref)
        5: Use ancestral allele as major (requires -anc)
        -rmTrans: remove transitions 0
        -skipTriallelic 0
```

A possible command line to estimate allele frequencies might be (this may take 1 min to run):
```
$NGS/angsd/angsd -b $DATA/EUR.bams -ref $REF -out Results/EUR \
        -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -trim 0 -C 50 -baq 1 \
        -minMapQ 20 -minQ 20 -minInd 5 -setMinDepth 7 -setMaxDepth 30 -doCounts 1 \
        -GL 1 -doGlf 1 \
	-doMajorMinor 1 -doMaf 1
```
where we specify:
* -doMajorMinor 1: both alleles are inferred from genotype likelihoods
* -doMaf 1: major and minor are fixed

What are the output files?
* "Results/EUR.arg"
* "Results/EUR.mafs.gz"
`.args` file is a summary of all options used, while `.mafs.gz` file shows the allele frequencies computed at each site.

Have a look at this file which contains estimates of allele frequency values.
```
zcat Results/EUR.mafs.gz | head
```
and you may see something like
```
chromo	position	major	minor	ref	knownEM	nInd
2	108999945	C	A	C	0.000004	5
2	108999946	T	A	T	0.000004	5
2	108999947	T	A	T	0.000004	5
2	108999948	C	A	C	0.000004	5
2	108999949	T	A	T	0.000004	5
2	108999950	A	C	A	0.000004	5
2	108999951	T	A	T	0.000004	5
2	108999952	G	A	G	0.000004	5
2	108999953	A	C	A	0.000002	5
```
where `knownEM` specifies the algorithm used to estimate the allele frequency which is given under that column.
Please note that this refers to the allele frequency of the allele labelled as `minor`.
The columns are: chromosome, position, major allele, minor allele, reference allele, allele frequency, p-value for SNP calling (if -SNP-pval was called), number of individuals with data.
The last column gives the number of samples with data (you can see that this never below 5 given our filtering).

You can notice that many sites have low allele frequency, probably reflecting the fact that that site is monomorphic.
We may be interested in looking at allele frequencies only for sites that are actually variable in our sample.
Therefore we want to perform a **SNP calling**.
There are two main ways to call SNPs using ANGSD with these options:
```
        -minMaf         0.000000        (Remove sites with MAF below)
        -SNP_pval       1.000000        (Remove sites with a pvalue larger)
```
Therefore we can consider assigning as SNPs sites whose estimated allele frequency is above a certain threhsold (e.g. the frequency of a singleton) or whose probability of being variable is above a specified value.

** QUICK EXERCISE**

As an illustration, call SNPs by computing:
 - genotype likelihoods using GATK method;
 - major and minor alleles inferred from genotype likelihoods;
 - frequency from known major allele but unknown minor;
 - SNPs as those having MAF=>0.05.

Try to write down this command by yourself and comment the results.

As a general guidance, `-GL 1`, `-doMaf 1/2` and `-doMajorMinor 1` should be the preferred choice when data uncertainty is high.
If interested in analysing very low frequency SNPs, then `-doMaf 2` should be selected.
When accurate information on reference sequence or outgroup are available, one can use `-doMajorMinor` to 4 or 5.
Also, detecting variable sites based on their probability of being SNPs is generally a better choice than defining a threshold on the allele frequency.
However, various cutoffs and a dedicated filtering should be perform to assess robustness of your called SNPs.

**QUICK EXERCISE**

Try varying the cutoff for SNP calling and record how many sites are predicted to be variable for each scenario.
Identify which sites are not predicted to be variable anymore with a more stringent cutoff (e.g. between a pair of scenario), and plot their allele frequencies.
Use the previously calculated genotype likelihoods as input file (use ```-glf ? -fai ? -nInd ?```).
```
# iterate over some cutoffs (you can change these)
for PV in 0.05 1e-2 1e-4 1e-6
do
        if [ $PV == 0.05 ]; then echo SNP_pval NR_SNPs; fi
        $NGS/angsd/angsd -glf Results/EUR.glf.gz -nInd 10 -fai $REF.fai -out Results/EUR.$PV \
                -doMajorMinor 1 -doMaf 1 -skipTriallelic 1 \
                -SNP_pval $PV &> /dev/null
        echo $PV `zcat Results/EUR.$PV.mafs.gz | tail -n+2 | wc -l`
done
```

A possible output is (your numbers may be different):
```
SNP_pval NR_SNPs
0.05 4405
1e-2 2950
1e-4 1428
1e-6 1084
```

Which sites differ from 0.05 and 0.01? What is their frequency?
This script will also print out the first 20 discordant sites (pK.EM is the p-value for the SNP calling test).
```
Rscript -e 'mafs1 <- read.table(gzfile("Results/EUR.1e-2.mafs.gz"), he=T, row.names=NULL, strings=F); mafs5 <- read.table(gzfile("Results/EUR.0.05.mafs.gz"), header=T, row.names=NULL, stringsAsFact=F); mafs5[!(mafs5[,2] %in% mafs1[,2]),][1:20,]; pdf(file="Results/diffSnpCall.pdf"); par(mfrow=c(1,2)); hist(as.numeric(mafs5[!(mafs5[,2] %in% mafs1[,2]),][,6]), main="Discordant SNPs", xlab="MAF", xlim=c(0,0.5)); hist(as.numeric(mafs5[(mafs5[,2] %in% mafs1[,2]),][,6]), main="Concordant SNPs", xlab="MAF", xlim=c(0,0.5)); dev.off();'
```

What can you conclude from these results?
Which frequencies are more difficult to estimate and therefore affect SNP calling?

**EXERCISE 2**

Estimate derived allele frequencies for all populations of interest using a likelihood approach, without relying on genotype calls.
What is the difference compared to what previously estimated?
