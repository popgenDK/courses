    "We will use the `psmc` tool to estimate the effective population size for our data. But instead of directly using bam files, we will use a variant calling format (vcf) file as the starting point. In this tutorial, we will first take a look at a vcf file, then look at how a vcf file is converted to an input for `psmc` using a custom python script. And finally, run psmc on simulated and real data to see how well we can estimate effective population size $N_e$. Note that, unlike many of the previous tools you used in this course, `psmc` relies on high coverage data where we can estimate genotypes accurately, which is one of the reasons we are working in our exercises with vcf files.

In the second half of the exercises, we will use data from the 1000 genomes project, namely 2 individuals, NA12718 - a CEU female sample (Northern European ancestry), and NA19471 - a female Luhya sample from Kenya, to compare and contrast how the effective population sizes vary between these two populations.

This pattern allows us to estimate the same parameter for multiple consecutive time bins. For example - the default pattern 4+5\\*3+4 splits time up into 23 bins (4+15+4), where only 1 parameter is estimated for the first 4 bins, then 1 parameter is estimmated for the next 5 triples of bins, and 1 parameter for the last 4 bins.

Try and see if using differe parameters will help - keep the same number of total time slices, but change the partitioning, and subsequently change the number of time slices as well. Some examples could be - \"2+10\\*2+1\", \"6+11\\*1+6\", \"4+20\\*2+6\", \"2+30\\*1+2\". Try these parameters and see how the output changes - also look at the convergence, and output log file."
